1. 'git add  -A.' [This is how you add the files. This doesn't upload anything]
2. 'git commit -m "INSERT MESSAGE"' 
3. 'git push origin main'

## Tips
- 'git status' [This will tell you at what stage your repo is at]
- Make sure you save all your files.
- Always double check that you are in the right folder
